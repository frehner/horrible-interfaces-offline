# Offline versions of Horrible Interfaces

These are just offline-enabled versions of [these](https://codepen.io/collection/nvmBQV/). Why? In case the internet is bad at the conferences that I give this talk at.

Hopefully each one of these is self-contained, and can just be viewed by opening the raw HTML file in a browser.

The exception is `dotty.html`, for which you need to run a small static server with CORS to get to work correctly. One easy way would be to do the following in your terminal:

```sh
npx http-server tensorflow/ --cors
```
